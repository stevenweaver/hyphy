Relaxation parameter K = 0.4389230603260226 \n[RELAX] Likelihood ratio test for relaxation on Test branches, p = 0.0001594057084282063   The result of the analysis is that \"Test\" (recipient) branches have   that scales like    K , where  K  is 0.4389, i.e., shrink towards 1 (selection is weaker). The likelihood ratio test is to reject  K=1  (no difference is selective pressure), which yields a highly significant p = 0.00016 here.  Like in other analyses, HyPhy will generate a JSON file (e.g.,  HIV.nex.RELAX.json ) storing all the relevant analysis output, which can be visualized with this  web app . For example, you can see the fitted rate distributions.",
